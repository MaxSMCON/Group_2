If we don’t have enough material for analysis, we will Potentially Extend to Carbon Emission impact to WFH, Green House Emissions

**Review for Next Meeting  : **

Review the Papers 

Look at the data set uploaded on GoogleDrive - csv files for pre covid data is posted. 

All group members Create Git hub account and access the links to the papers 

Ramila emailed Mr Gibbs for Link to Covid period data. - Mr Gibbs responded apparently the data used in analysis is priopriety in nature so they can't share. Need to go else where. 


Recap November 13th, 2021
Revised the Topic for submission 

Topic :  Food affordably in developing countries 
Data Source  - https://www.kaggle.com/lasaljaywardena/global-food-prices-starter/data?select=global_food_prices.csv

Problem Statement – Comparing Global Food Prices in developing countries versus per capita Income 

November 14th, 2021
Looking to finalize task allocation 
Objectives: What are you setting out to prove or predict? What is your rationale for there being a correlation in the data that you’re looking to confirm and/or exploit?
Data Preparation: What was your data source (e.g., web scraping, corporate data, a standard machine learning dataset, open data, etc.)? How good was the data quality? What did you need to do to procure it? What tools or code did you need to use to prepare it for analysis? What challenges did you face?
Analysis or model: If you are conducting an inference test, explain the analysis you performed clearly and include well-labelled diagrams to make your points. If you chose to do a predictive model, explain the model, how you trained and tested it, and how well it works. How did you confirm that the data met the requirements for the test or modelling technique to be valid?
Conclusions: Did you prove/disprove your hypothesis or create a useful model? What did you learn about your data set?

<br /> Recap November 21st, 2021
<br /> Google Colab file connection work to MaxSMCON\MaxSMCON - Git Hub - working file will be posted here
<br /> CSV files we are using are - Global Food Prices, GDP, US Dollar Conversion Table per Country, Countries vs Region, Population - Ramila 
<br /> We decided to use current US dollar information as it will be hard to get 
<br /> Maxim will upload the csv for Conversion file on Google Drive. 
<br /> Pivot the table - Ramila will work on the Pivot 
<br /> Identify most used Commodity - Top 10 Commodity Spread across the Countries - JOBBIN will do 
<br /> Conversion table needs apply to the tables - Ramila 
<br /> Maxim  - Autocorrelation for Top 10 Countries (Potential unite the countrys into regions)
<br /> Population Changes
<br /> Hypothesis  - Price is impacting the Population Growth? or GDP?
<br /> Next Sunday to check in on progress, Starting Nov 29th 
<br /> Rick-I'll work on to see if there is correlation between grocery index and restaurant index with the country pricing on food.<br />
